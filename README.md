# HacksGiving 2025
Thank you for participating in the HacksGiving 2025 competition!
In collaboriation with MSOE and Discovery World, AI-Club is hoping to provide an opportunity for our talented students to gain more hands-on AI experience for the chance to compete in a $6000, 3-day hackathon -- as well as build solutions that ultimately help a non-profit organization that traditionally is unable to invest into AI solutions!

For more information about what an appropriate solution looks like, as well as important dates, please refer to the Hacksgiving 2025 Hackathon Rubric
