## Hacksgiving: AI for Good Hackathon

November 20–23, 2025 • Discovery World, Milwaukee

Hacksgiving is MSOE’s annual AI-for-good hackathon where students use data, creativity, and engineering skills to support a local nonprofit with an AI-driven solution. This year’s partner was the Milwaukee Domes Alliance, a nonprofit that supports the educational and cultural programming of the Mitchell Park Domes.

Students received a problem statement and dataset from the nonprofit, then spent three days designing, building, and presenting solutions for the chance to win prize funding. Hacksgiving encourages hands-on creativity, real-world problem solving, and community impact. The event was created by Dr. Jeremy Kedziora, MSOE PieperPower Endowed Chair in AI.

### Our Solution: Plant It!

Plant It! is an AI-powered plant-planning tool designed for the Milwaukee Domes horticulture team.
Our goal: streamline plant selection by automating plant matching, trait analysis, and cost-aware planning.

Using the Companion Plant dataset, a global plant trait database, and a Random Forest classifier, our team engineered pairwise trait features to recommend compatible plant groupings. Plant It! also emphasizes scalability and real-world use:
- Simple, adaptable model
- Standalone React app
- Local compute-friendly
- Integrates into existing planning workflows

**Guided by data, grown by creativity — we can Plant It!**
